# Tourname
A OSS service for managing tournaments within an organization.

You have a table tennis, a pool table, a table soccer (or something similar) in your office and you always wanted to keep track of the matches between you and your colleagues? With `tourname` you can do that!
Create your own tournaments and see who comes out on top, challenge a single player and see the leaderboard results.
