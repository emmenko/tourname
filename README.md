# Tourname

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/emmenko/tourname.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
A OSS service for managing tournaments within an organization.

You have a table tennis, a pool table, a table soccer (or something similar) in your office and you always wanted to keep track of the matches between you and your colleagues? With `tourname` you can do that!
Create your own tournaments and see who comes out on top, challenge a single player and see the leaderboard results.


## TODO
* ~~dataloader for queries optimization~~
* tests for resolvers
* ~~(social) login authentication~~

$ yarn start
# - starts the backend server on port 3001
