# Tourname

A OSS service for managing tournaments within an organization.

## Background

You have a table tennis, a pool table, a table soccer (or something similar) in your office and you always wanted to keep track of the matches between you and your colleagues? With `tourname` you can do that!
Create your own tournaments and see who comes out on top, challenge a single player and see the leaderboard results.


## Development
_TBD_

```bash
$ yarn start
# - starts the backend server on port 3999
# - starts the web app on port 4000, using react-scripts
#   - compiles reason -> js in watch mode
```
